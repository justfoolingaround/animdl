<h2>This project: animdl</h2>

<br>

The core aim of this project is to co-relate automation and efficiency to extract what is provided to an user on the internet. Every content available in the project is hosted by external non-affiliated sources. 

<br>

<b>Any content served through this project is publicly accessible. If your site is listed in this project, the code is pretty much public. Take necessary measures to counter the exploits used to extract content in your site.</b>

Think of this project as your normal browser, but a bit more straight-forward and specific. While an average browser makes hundreds of requests to get everything from a site, this project goes on to make requests associated with only getting the content served by the sites.

<b>

This project is to be used at the user's own risk, based on their government and laws.

This project has no control on the content it is serving, using copyrighted content from the providers is not going to be accounted for by the developer. It is the user's own risk.
